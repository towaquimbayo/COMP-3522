# Assignment 1 - Snake Game üêç
Design and implement a Snake game in Python.


# Description
The snake should eat food, grow clear of walls and itself, and avoid obstacles. 


# Requirements
1. **Game Board and Display:**
   - Create a game board/grid where the snake will move.
   - Display the game board on the screen using Pygame graphical library.

1. **Snake Object:**
   - Create a snake object that consists of a series of linked segments.
   - Initialize the snake with a default length and position on the game board.
   - Implement methods for moving the snake in different directions (up, down, left, right).
   - Implement a method to check for collisions with walls or itself.
   - Increase the snake's length when it eats food.
   - Allow Snake to find the food using in an Auto-pilot mode. You may use a shortest path algorithm (e.g., [Breadth First Search Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDqjPvD54Ss&t=0s)) for the snake to find the food efficiently. You may use a keyboard key to toggle between the manual and auto-pilot mode.

1. **Food Object:**
   - Create a food object that appears randomly on the game board.
   - Ensure the food doesn't appear inside the snake.

1. **Game Logic:**
   - Handle user input to control the snake's movement.
   - Update the game board with the snake's position and the location of the food.
   - Detect collisions between the snake and food.
   - Increase the player's score when the snake eats food.
   - End the game when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
   - Display the player's score on the screen.

1. **Game Loop:**
   - Implement a game loop that continuously updates the game state and redraws the display.
   - Control the game speed to make it playable.

1. **User Interface:**
   - Display game over message when the snake loses.
   - Provide a way to restart the game after it ends.

1. **Scoring:**
   - Keep track of the player's score based on the number of food items eaten.

1. **Documentation:**
    - Provide clear documentation for the code, including class descriptions, function explanations, and how to play the game.


Design and implement your Snake game using object-oriented programming principles in Python. You'll likely have classes for the game board, snake, food, and the main game engine, among others, to encapsulate the game's logic and functionality.


# Marking Scheme
**1: Game Functionality (55 points)**

1. **Game Initialization (10 points)**
   - Properly initialize the game board, snake, and food objects.
   - Ensure the snake doesn't collide with itself or the wall at the start.
1. **Snake Movement (10 points)**
   - Implement smooth and responsive movement controls (up, down, left, right) or (W, S, A, D).
   - Handle collisions with the wall and snake's own body correctly.
1. **Food Generation and Consumption (10 points)**
   - Randomly generate food on the game board.
   - Detect of snake-food collisions.
   - Increase the snake's length upon eating food.
1. **Game Logic and State Management (10 points)**
   - Track the player's score.
   - Detect game over conditions.
   - Implementrestart functionality.
1. **Shortest Path Algorithm (15)**
   - Enable the snake to enable Auto-pilot mode to find the food. Y

**2: Code Quality and Structure (25 points)**

1. **Object-Oriented Design (10 points)**
   - Organizing code into classes and methods.
   - Demonstrate encapsulation and abstraction principles.
   - Break down the code into reusable and logical modules.
   - Minimize code duplication through proper modularization.
1. **Documentation (10 points)**
   - Provide clear and concise comments and docstrings.
   - Describe the purpose of classes, methods, and important variables.
1. **Code Readability (5 points)**
   - Use meaningful variable and function names.
   - Maintain consistent code formatting and style.

**3: Class Diagram Discussion (10 points)** 
   - Draw a class diagram for the game. 

**4: SOLID Principles Compliance (10 points)**   
   - **Briely** Discuss how SOLID principles are applied in the code. Include this discussion in YT video.



**5: Demo and Testing**
1. **Record 2-3 minutes YT video (-40 points if not done)**
    - Demonstre the game's functionality and features.
    - Ensure that the game runs smoothly without crashes.
    - Briefly discuss the code structure and design.
    - Discuss how SOLID principles are applied.
2. **Proper Commits (-20 posnts if not done)**
   - Use proper commit messages.
   - Commit often and regularly.
   - Keep commits small and focused.

**Total: 100 points**
