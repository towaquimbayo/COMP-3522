# Lab 1 - Python Modules and Functions
1. 	Create a module (a python file ending in .py) called `hypotenuse.py` in the lab1 folder.
2.	Write a function `calculate_hypotenuse()` that given two attributes (the lengths of two sides of a right angled triangle) calculates the length of the hypotenuse.

3. 	Write a calculator in `driver.py` that implements the my_sum(), my_multiply(), my_divide() and my_subtract() functions. Query the user for 2 values and present them with a menu of operators. Evaluate the result and print it out.
