class Request:
    """
    The request object represents a request to either encrypt or decrypt
    certain data. The request object comes with certain accompanying
    configuration options as well as a field that holds the result. The
    attributes are:
        - encryption_state: 'en' for encrypt, 'de' for decrypt
        - data_input: This is the string data that needs to be encrypted or
        decrypted. This is None if the data is coming in from a file.
        - input_file: The text file that contains the string to be encrypted or
        decrypted. This is None if the data is not coming from a file and is
        provided directly.
        - output: This is the method of output that is requested. At this
        moment the program supports printing to the console or writing to
        another text file.
        - key: The Key value to use for encryption or decryption.
        - result: Placeholder value to hold the result of the encryption or
        decryption. This does not usually come in with the request.
