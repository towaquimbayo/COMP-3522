**Lab 6 - Observer Pattern, Callable Objects and Comprehensions**


**Welcome!**

In today's lab, you will:

1.  Simulate an auction involving an auctioneer and bidders using the observer pattern

2.  Get a chance to use dictionary comprehension

3.  Experiment with callable objects (refer to the sample code 'callable_object_example.py' uploaded for this lab)

**Grading**

This lab and all future labs will be marked out of 10

For full marks this week, you must:

1.  (80 points) Generate a correct solution and implementing the observer pattern

2.  (20 points) For the correct use of callable objects and dictionary comprehensions


**Requirements**

For this lab you will implement an Auction House simulation that
consists of an Auction, an Auctioneer and a number of Bidders. All your
code should be in one module that is provided for you: **driver.py**.

Let\'s break down each of our classes. I\'ve listed the attributes I
expect to see **I have provided you with some skeleton code to start off with**. Feel free to add/remove any methods or functions or change the class design however you feel. The rest of the class design is up to you. **DO NOT** create any other classes besides these 3.

**Bidder - The Observer**

Bidders are the people who place the bids during an auction. These
observe the auctioneer. Every time the auctioneer accepts a bid, all the
bidders should be notified and given the chance to retaliate by placing
a new bid. A bidder cannot retaliate to their own bid.

Each bidder has the following attributes:

-   `name`

    -   The name of the bidder

-   `budget`

    -   The amount of money that the bidder is willing to spend. The
 bidder will not make a bid greater than this amount.

-   `bid_probability`

    -   This is a floating point value between 0 and 1. This represents
 the percentage probability chance that this bidder will
 retaliate to a bid with their own bid.

-   `bid_increase_perc`

    -   This is a number greater than 1 . A value of 1.4 translates to  140%. This percentage is the value of the new bid that the  bidder places. For example, if the bidder has a `bid_increase_perc` value of 1.5 (that is, 150%) then if this  bidder were to place a bid, it would be 1.5 times the current  highest bid on the item.

-   `highest_bid`

    -   The highest bid amount that was bid by this bidder.

The bidder should be a callable object. A callable object is an object that can be called as a function. For example, if I have an object my_object which implements the `__call__(self)` protocol, then I can execute the object as a function by typing `my_object()`. This would invoke the `__call__(self)` method in the background. You can add any number of parameters to this protocol to pass arguments when invoking the object as a function. Refer to the sample code uploaded alongside this lab for an example.

The bidder should implement `__call__(self, auctioneer)`. This method should allow the bidder to place a new bid with the auctioneer (thereby causing another new bid, causing the auctioneer to notify all the observers again). Remember, a bidder should only bid if:

-   The bid is against another bidder and not against themselves

-   The amount that they bid (dictated by `bid_increase_perc`` is not greater than their budget

-   After accounting for their bid_probability . (Hint: use the `random.random()` method to generate a random float between 0 and 1 (exclusive) )

**Auctioneer - The Core**

The Auctioneer is the core object being observed in our observer pattern. The auctioneer is responsible for maintaining a list of bidders and notifying them (calling them as functions) if and when it accepts a
new bid.

An auctioneer (not a static class in case you were planning to make it static) contains the following attributes:

-   `bidders` A list of bidder objects that the auctioneer can call as a function.

-   `highest_current_bid` The value of the highest current bid.

-   `highest_current_budder` A reference to the highest current bidder.

The auctioneer can accept new bids and if this bid is greater than the highest_current_bid then it accepts the bid and notifies all the bidders **EXCEPT** for the bidder that placed the new bid. Remember, each Bidder expects a reference of the auctioneer to be passed to it when it is called.

**Auction - Our controller that starts the simulation**

The Auction class represents an auction object. Again this is not a static class (I do not want to see any static methods in this lab).

The Auction is responsible for setting up and starting an auction for an item with a starting price. An Auction should implement `__init__(self, bidders)` as its initialization parameters. Bidders refers to a list of participating bidder objects.

The Auction is responsible for registering the bidders to the Auctioneer (so they can be called back as part of the observer pattern). Once registered, the auction starts by placing the item and `starting_price` as the first bid via the `simulate_auction` function. This should cause all
the observers to be notified which should lead to a chain of new bids which in turn, cause the observers to be notified again.

Once the chain has come to an end (either no one bids or everyone has exhausted their budget), the Auction object should print out the result of the auction. This should be the name of the Bidder and the winning bid.

OPTIONAL CHALLENGE - use Dictionary Comprehensions to iterate over all the bidders, and create a dictionary where each bidder is the key and their highest bid is the associated value. Print out a summary where each bidder\'s name and their highest bid is displayed.

**Sample Output**

Your `main()` method should prompt the user for the following:

1.  The name of the item being auctioned

2.  The starting price

3.  The number of bidders and the details of each bidder

    a.  Optional: Have some test bidders preloaded. Give the user an
 option to add more bidders or use the existing test bidders

Once this has been done, create an Auction object and start the auction simulation! A possible output can look like the snipper below. Since we aren\'t worrying about a dedicated UI class, your print statements can be put wherever you deem them to be necessary.

-   Ensure you push your work to github classroom. I\'d like to see sensible git commits comments, and commits must take place at logical points in development.

That's it. Good luck, and have fun!
