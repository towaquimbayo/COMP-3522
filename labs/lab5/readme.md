**Lab 5: Testing, Exceptions and File Handling**


**Welcome!**

In today's lab, you will:

1.  Implement a simple English dictionary program that reads and writes data to a file.

2.  Demonstrate proficiency in writing code that is efficient, easy to understand, and correct.

3.  Identify crucial functions and write meaningful unit tests

4.  Continue to bask in the joy of programming. Because you do love it, don't you!

**Grading**

This lab and all future labs will be marked out of 10

For full marks this week, you must:


1.  (50% points) Generate a correct solution to the problem(s) in this lab

1.  (50% points) Create meaningful unit tests


**Requirements**

Please complete the following:

1.  There is a JSON file included with the project that contains (perhaps) all the words in the english dictionary. If not all, then definitely a lot. Each word may have more than one definition associated with it. Open up the file in a text editor and take a look at the data. Does this remind you of a container data structure?

1.  This lab onwards I\'m going to be picky about how your modules are arranged. So, just for this lab I\'m going to specify the module structure:

    -   `driver.py` - This module is responsible for housing the
   dictionary class (alongside any custom exceptions that apply
   to the dictionary) and any driver methods that run the
   program.

    -   `file_handler.py` - This module is responsible for housing any
   classes and/or structures that are responsible for reading and
   writing to files. This includes any custom exceptions.

1.  You are going to write a dictionary program that is going to demonstrate the following:

    1.  Loading definitions from a JSON file.

    2.  Querying the user for an input (a word) and returning any
   definitions that match with the given input. Your program
   should not be case sensitive. That is, Rain, RAin, and rain
   should all return the same definition.

    3.  The program should save all the words and definitions queried to
   a text file.

    4.  Your ability to handle any errors and edge cases gracefully.
    
1.  In true Object Oriented fashion, we are going to encapsulate all file behaviors in a separate entity. Your program should support 2 file types: .txt and .json . A good way to implement this is to create an enum type. You can look at the python documentation for enums to see how they are used and implemented. ([[https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html]{.underline}](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html))

1.  Implement a FileExtensions Enum that has 2 valid states, TXT and JSON.

1.  Implement a **FileHandler** class that has the following methods and features:

    -   A load_data(path, file_extension_enum) static method. This
   method is responsible for checking the file extension, reading
   the file accordingly, and saving the data into a dictionary
   that is returned. This method is also responsible for raising
   any exceptions if they occur. You might need to look up the
   pathlib module to be able to check if the file exists. Note:
   the program may read from data.json or data.txt.

        -   ensure load_data works with both .json and .txt files. For
       instance, if "data.txt" is passed into your program, it
       should have code to properly parse the words and
       definitions into a dictionary.

    -   A write_lines(path, lines) static method. This method is
   responsible for writing the given lines to a **Text** file.
   The text file should be appended to and not overwritten. Note:
   the program will ONLY WRITE to data.txt

    -   Anything else you deem relevant and necessary.
    
1.  The `file_handler.py` should also house an InvalidFileTypeError class. This exception should be raised if the user attempts to read a file that is not a .json or a .txt file (or in other words, if the user attempts to read a file that is not supported by the FileExtensions enum).

1.  Your **dictionary** should implement the following methods and features:

    -   A dictionary needs to be loaded. Implement a
   load_dictionary(self, filepath) method that is responsible for
   loading data into a dictionary

    -   A dictionary needs to be able to look up the definition of a
   word. Implement a query_definition(self, word) method that
   returns the definition(s) of a given word.

    -   A way to keep track of whether the dictionary has been loaded or
   not. This will be useful when testing your applications.

> Optional: Use the difflib library to suggest similar words in case the
> user enters an incorrect word and it isn\'t found in the dictionary.
> Remember, the program should not be case sensitive! RAInn should
> return rain as a suggestion.

1.  Remember to raise and handle any exceptions appropriately. Declare custom exceptions if you think it is necessary.

1.  Write meaningful unit tests for your program. Make sure you write unit tests that test with both correct and incorrect input. Ensure you test the following:

    -   Loading data into a dictionary.

    -   Writing data to a text file. What assertion can you use to test
   this?

    -   Querying a word.

    -   Anything else you deem necessary

1.  Your program should load the dictionary and provide the user with the option to keep querying definitions until the user has entered exitprogram as their input. Remember to format your output and any definitions nicely.

1.  Don\'t forget, your program should use the try-except-else-finally or any variation of it to handle any errors that your code might encounter. Where and when you raise and handle errors will depend on the architecture of your code and how your functions are logically laid out.

1.  Also don\'t forget to save the definitions and words that the user queries to a text file.

Ensure you push your work to github classroom. I\'d like to see sensible
git commits comments, and commits must take place at logical points in
development.

That's it. Good luck, and have fun!

**Things to note:**

load_dictionary(self, filepath)

Accepts one filepath variable that will be a string. For example:
"data.json" This can be used to determine if the extension is json or
txt

Save "data.json" and 'data.txt' in the same folder level as your .py
files

I purposely didn't provide a "data.txt" file. You can save the
words/definitions in any format you'd like. The words and definitions in
"data.txt" can be different than the words and definitions in
"data.json"
